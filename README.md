#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0PcZVEHvrg>
#### Description:
Kind regards all and all, this is my final project for cs50x.

Basically it's a portfolio self website that introduces myself and skills,
links to socials for contact, some 3 projects that I've built and hosted on github, my cv and contact options via mail and linkedin.

The website is basically a one page landing page, where you can jump between sections by taping the arrow (on right bottom corners of each container of the page) or by clicking the navigation bar at the top or bottom footer section. It's also mobile friendly. 

# Sections of code:
-----------
#### index.html 
contains the whole project basically, html layout of the website, different sections of it (main, experience, , contact) and css classes and id's that manipulate the design of the page.

#### Style.css

#### mediaqueries.css
Basically manipulates website behavior across multiple screens, web client and mobile device client size.

#### script.js
